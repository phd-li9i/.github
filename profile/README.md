This organisation hosts some of the repositories that I, Alexandros Philotheou, am able to make public, which are the result of my PhD studies in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, at the Aristotelian University of Thessaloniki, during the years 2018-2023.

My research has led to the following publications:
- [2023] [Correspondenceless scan-to-map-scan matching of 2D panoramic range scans](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590005623000139)
- [2022] [FSM: Correspondenceless scan-matching of panoramic 2D range scans](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9981228)
- [2021] [Correspondenceless scan-to-map-scan matching of homoriented 2D scans for mobile robot localisation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921889021002323)
- [2021] [Passive Global Localisation of Mobile Robot via 2D Fourier-Mellin Invariant Matching](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10846-021-01535-7)
- [2020] [Pose Selection and Feedback Methods in Tandem Combinations of Particle Filters with Scan-Matching for 2D Mobile Robot Localisati](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10846-020-01253-6)
